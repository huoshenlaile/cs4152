	 * The method called to provide a deterministic application loop.

	 * This method provides an application loop that runs at a guaranteed fixed
	 * timestep. This method is (logically) invoked every {@link getFixedStep}
	 * microseconds. By that we mean if the method {@link draw} is called at
	 * time T, then this method is guaranteed to have been called exactly
	 * floor(T/s) times this session, where s is the fixed time step.
	 *
	 * This method is always invoked in-between a call to {@link #preUpdate}
	 * and {@link #postUpdate}. However, to guarantee determinism, it is
	 * possible that this method is called multiple times between those two
	 * calls. Depending on the value of {@link #getFixedStep}, it can also
	 * (periodically) be called zero times, particularly if {@link #getFPS}
	 * is much faster.
	 *
	 * As such, this method should only be used for portions of the application
	 * that must be deterministic, such as the physics simulation. It should
	 * not be used to process user input (as no user input is recorded between
	 * {@link #preUpdate} and {@link #postUpdate}) or to animate models.
	 *
	 * The time passed to this method is NOT the same as the one passed to

	 * In particular, it should be used to interpolate any visual differences
