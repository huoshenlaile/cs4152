//  RGGameScene.h
//  Ragdoll Demo
//
//  This is the most important class in this demo.  This class manages the gameplay
//  for this demo.  It also handles collision detection. There is not much to do for
//  collisions; our WorldController class takes care of all of that for us.  This
//  controller mainly transforms input into gameplay.
//
//  You will notice that we do not use a Scene asset this time.  While we could
//  have done this, we wanted to highlight the issues of connecting physics
//  objects to scene graph objects.  Hence we include all of the API calls.
//
//  WARNING: There are a lot of shortcuts in this design that will do not adapt
//  well to data driven design. This demo has a lot of simplifications to make
//  it a bit easier to see how everything fits together. However, the model
//  classes and how they are initialized will need to be changed if you add
//  dynamic level loading.
//
//  This file is based on the CS 3152 PhysicsDemo Lab by Don Holden (2007).
//  This file has been refactored to support the physics changes in CUGL 2.5.
